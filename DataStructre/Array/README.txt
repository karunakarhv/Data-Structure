Two-D Array

Imagined as a matrix- Two D array

Given an array of a[m][n]

1. Row Major Arrangement
If we want to find the address of particular location say a[i][j] then its
address is calculated as = base address + i * n + j
 
2. Column Major Arrangement
If we want to find the address of particular location say a[i][j] then its
address is calculated as = base address + j * m + i 

Common Matrix Operations:
1.Addition
2.Multiplication
3.Transposition
4.Determinant of a Square Matrix
